FizzBuzz:
1. Create a function that will convert any number dividable by 3 to the text "Fizz".
2. Expand the function so that any number dividable by 5 is converted to "Buzz"
3. Expand the function so that any number dividable by both 3 and 5 is converted to "FizzBuzz"

BONUS:
- Expand the function so that any number containing 3 returns "Fizz", 5 returns "Buzz", and both 3 and 5 returns "FizzBuzz"
- Expand the function so that prime numbers returns "Woff"
- Create a function that takes in a list of numbers and counts the number of occurances of "Fizz", another function that counts the number of "Buzz", counts the number of "FizzBuzz", and counts the number of "Woofs".
- Rewrite the conversion function so that it does not use modulo.
