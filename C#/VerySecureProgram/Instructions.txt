Very Secure Program Kata

This Kata is all about making legacy code testable, by abstracting away dependencies and test small chunks of the functionality.

This task has 4 main tasks:
- Break the dependency on the Console
- Get the password comparison feature under test
- Get the password validation feature under test
- Add feature to allow different encryption algorithms to be used.

If these are all complete you can try out these bonus tasks:
- Add feature to allow different outputs, ie. write to file.
- Expand the password comparison feature so that the password must contains at least 
	- two capitol letters
	- two numbers
	- one symbol.

Thanks to Geir Marius Gjul for setting up the project.
